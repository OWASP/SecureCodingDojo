**Input Validation** is one of the basic tenets of software security. Verifying that the values provided to the application match the expected type or format, goes a long way in reducing the attack surface. Validation is a simple countermeasure with super results.

It is important to note that a common mistake is to use `block lists` for validation. For example an application will prevent symbols that are known to cause trouble. The weakness of this appproach is that some symbols may be overlooked.
