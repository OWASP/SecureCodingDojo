<h5>About the vulnerabilities</h5>
<p>
   <strong>Broken Authentication</strong>
   is the failure of an authentication mechanism to correctly identify a user. Spoofing 
   attacks to session identifiers, missing cookie headers and brute force attacks on passwords are part of this category.<br>
   
   <strong>Broken Access Control</strong>
   is the failure of an application to restrict access to resources. Authorization flaws, 
    privilege escalation, reliance on client side and path traversal facilitate attacks in this category.<br>

    <i>Attackers have access to hundreds of millions of valid username and password combinations for credential stuffing, 
        default administrative account lists, automated brute force, and dictionary attack tools. 
        Session management attacks are well understood, particularly in relation to unexpired session tokens.</i>

<p>
    <i>Access control weaknesses are common due to the lack of automated detection, and lack of effective functional testing by application developers.
            Access control detection is not typically amenable to automated static or dynamic testing...</i>

<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
<p>
    In the previous challenge you have broken into the test account. In this challenge you must perform an authorization attack by changing
     from the test account to one of the hackers' accounts. You can achieve that by attacking the session identifier (which is a case of 
     broken authentication). The JWT token is stored in the browser session storage.
     <br> <br>
     The application is using JWT for authentication. JWT contains a JSON object signed with a secret or RSA private key in the best cases.
     Getting a hold of the JWT secret can proove devastating because attackers can impersonate anyone and can generate 'eternal' session identifiers
     (which never expire).
     The JWT secret in this case is very weak so you can easily crack it by writing a script that tries some of the most insecure passwords.
     <br> <br>
     In Node.JS you can use a script like this to verify a bunch of secrets:
     <pre class="pre-scrollable">
             const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
             var token = "ENTER_THE_TOKEN";
             var secrets = ["passw0rd","secret","1234"];
             //if you're looking for secrets there's a good list here: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/21/lame_passwords_exposed_by_rockyou_hack/
             secrets.forEach(function(secret){

                jwt.verify(token, secret, function(err, decoded) {
                    if (err) {
                        console.log('failed jwt verify: ', err);
                    } else {
                        console.log('authorized:', decoded);
                    }
                });

            });
     </pre>
    <br>
    In Node.JS you can generate JWT tokens with a script like this:
    <pre class="pre-scrollable">
            const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
            var token = jwt.sign({"sub": "username","name": "User Name"}, "SECRET");
            console.log(token);
    </pre>
    Once you impersonate one of the attackers, you will also notice that 
    one of the messages points to the location of the code for the entire infrastructure, including lambdas,
     malware and control application.

    API Gateway will break the binary content however you can get the content via an S3 url once you figure out the file names ;)
