<p>
    You work for the cyber security division of a government agency. 
    A digital currency mining malware, which takes advantage of an OS vulnerability, is loose across the world causing all kind of mayhem. 
    The malware spreads through a flaw in a well-known network protocol but initially is being distributed via malicious e-mail attachments. 
    Your task is to investigate the malware Command and Control infrastructure and if possible dismantle it from the source in order to prevent further damage 
    to millions of devices worldwide. 
    <br><br>
    You don’t have time to wait for the service provider, you must hack into the service on your own and send the <strong>stop</strong> command
    to millions of bots worldwide.
    <br><br>     
    Luckily hackers are not very much into secure coding, so there are many OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities that you can take advantage of. 
    Each exploit that you do will give you additional information and bring you closer to the end goal.
    <br><br>     
    You have an older version of the malware executable which you can download at the play link. 
    This older version has been deactivated using a kill switch so you can’t figure out the address of the CnC just by intercepting network traffic. 
    You have to reverse the code. It is a Windows .Net application so you can decompile it easily. 
    Once you decompile it you can analyze the code to figure out where to get started.
    <br></br>
    You don't absolutely need a decompiler, you can just use the <code>strings</code> linux command, and see what strings your can find and how they are 'encoded'.

<h5>Before you begin</h5>
<p>
Install the following if you don't have them already:
<br>- DotPeek from JetBrains (Windows) - optional
<br>- Bash or Git Bash
<br>- NodeJS 
<br>- VS Code - optional
<br>- OWASP ZAP Proxy or if you prefer Burp or Postman 
<br>- OpenSSL
<br>- Ysoserial (pen-test tool for deserialization attacks)

<h5>About the vulnerabilities: Security Misconfiguration</h5>
<p>
   Public S3 buckets have been in the news a lot. The obvious misconfiguration in this case is that they were made public instead of being protected.
   The Security Misconfiguration category includes many other flaws such as left over test accounts, default credentials or incorrect file system permissions.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    <i>Attackers will often attempt to exploit unpatched flaws or access default accounts, 
        unused pages, unprotected files and directories, etc to gain unauthorized access or knowledge of the system.</i>
</p>

<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
<p>
    After decompiling the malware you will find that each bot registers with the CnC by putting a message into a S3 bucket.
    <br> <br>
    The hackers are not so naive to leave their S3 buckets public. However they have chosen to build some quick online services using API Gateway
     S3 integrations. They simply followed the tutorial on integrating API Gateway with S3 located at this link: 
     <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/integrating-api-with-aws-services-s3.html">
        Create an API as an Amazon S3 Proxy</a>.
    <br>    <br> 
    However they did not implement bucket permissions and have inadvertently gave their API access to ALL the S3 buckets.
<br> <br>
    View the 'secret' file that was left around in the message bucket to pass this challenge. What else can you see in there :)?
