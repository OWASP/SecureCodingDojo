<p>
    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the following MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: 'Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')'

     
  <blockquote>
    <p>
         <i>The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, 
           but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.</i>

<h5>About SQL Injection</h5>
<p>
  SQL Injection is listed as the most dangerous Software flaw on both SANS 25 and OWASP Top 10 list. 
  It is the reason for most large user data breaches of this century: the Rock You breach, the Heartland Payment Systems data breach to name a few.
</p>
<p>
SQL injection is possible when database statements are constructed dynamically, through concatenation of SQL Commands and user input.
The following Java EE code demonstrates SQL injection through concatenation.
</p>
<pre>
    String usr = req.getParameter("usr");
    String pwd = req.getParameter("pwd");
    <strong>String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE usr =<mark>'"+ usr + "'" + "</mark> AND pwd=<mark>'" + pwd + "'"</mark>;</strong>
    Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
</pre>
<p>
This code is vulnerable to SQL Injection because an attacker can bypass authentication by simply entering <code>admin'--</code> in the user name.
The -- are SQL comments. The actual statement now becomes:
<div class="alert alert-danger">SELECT * FROM users WHERE usr='<code>admin'</code></div>
</p>
<p>Another common method of attack is <mark>tautology</mark>. This involves manipulating the WHERE clause to make it become true.</p>

<br>
<h5>About the Challenge</h5>
<p>
  After so many unauthorized access events the admin has finally changed their password. They have made it extra difficult so it can't be cracked.
</p>
<p>
  The developers of the site, store the user names and passwords in a database. 
  Here is the application code that executes during login. See if you can spot the problem.
  Thre's some blacklisting involved so the payload above <mark>won't work</mark>. You will have to find another way.
</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
usr = usr.replace("-","");
pwd = pwd.replace("-","");
Connection conn = db.getConn();
int count=0;
try{
  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
  String query = String.format("select * from users where usr='%s' and pwd='%s'",usr,pwd);
  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
    while (rs.next()) {
        count++;
    }
}
catch(SQLException ex){
  exMessage = String.format("&lt;pre&gt;%s&lt;/pre&gt;",ex);
}
alertVisibility="";
if(count==1){
  session.setAttribute("cwe89loggedin",true)
