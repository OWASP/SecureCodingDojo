<h5>About the vulnerabilities: Injection</h5>
<p>
  Injection is discussed and demonstrated in detail under
   <strong>Brown Belt: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') and related flaws</strong>
    and under
    <strong>Brown Belt: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')</strong>
    <br>Please review those sections to refresh your memory and also the OWASP link below.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    <i>Injection flaws are very prevalent, particularly in legacy code. Injection vulnerabilities are often found in SQL, LDAP, XPath, or NoSQL queries,
         OS commands, XML parsers, SMTP headers, expression languages, and ORM queries.</i>

<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
<p>
    The attackers have built in a proxy service that can execute requests from the CnC environment, such as a ping request. 
    Very similar to the challenge under brown belt, the host name here allows more than it should. 
    Look for the 'secret' file on the file system of the 'pinger' host.
<br>
PS: Besides the 'secret' file you will find the coordinates of an internal application that is used to control the bots. 
The pinger will become your "beachhead" in interacting with this application.
