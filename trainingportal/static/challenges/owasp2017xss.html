<h5>About the vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting</h5>
<p>
  Cross-Site Scripting is discussed and demonstrated in detail under Purple Belt: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation 
  ('Cross-site Scripting'). Please review that section to refresh your memory and also the OWASP link below.

<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
<p>
    Reveal the source ip of the chat users by storing a hidden image into the chat messages on that page.
It must be <strong>exactly</strong> this html snippet <code>&lt;img src='https://gov.logger.good' width='0px'&gt;</code> . 
You will find out that you can inject more than just images, but only that particular html snippet will unlock the challenge.
<br><br>
Analyze the source of the page carefully. You'll notice that XSS is mostly prevented by using Angular templates except for one particular case.
<br><br>
There's also some handy utilities for you in that page to help you out, and don't forget your browser debugger.
