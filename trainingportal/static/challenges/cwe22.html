    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')".
  <blockquote>
    <p>
         <i>The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, 
           but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.</i>

  The developers of Insecure Inc. have recently implemented a privacy page. 
  They usually get a html file that gets edited by the compliance analyst and they place it in the public folder of the web application. 
  Then when the user accesses the privacy link they load the file and show it to the user.
</p>
<p>
    Unrelated to this they have also recently created a servlet that connects to an external feed service. 
    They store the password in a properties file. They pass the location of the properties file to the servlet through an initialization parameter defined in <code>WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>
</p>
<p>
  Your task is to get the password stored in the configuration file.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the application code. See if you can spot the problem.
</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Path traversal is also known as a "dot dot slash attack".</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
String file = request.getParameter("file");
String successMessage = "";
if(file!=null){ 
  file = "public/"+file;
  InputStream input = null;
  BufferedReader reader = null;
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
  try {
    input = getServletContext().getResourceAsStream(file);

    reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input,"UTF-8"));
    String line = reader.readLine();

    while (line != null) {
        sb.append(line);
        sb.append("\n");
        line = reader.readLine();
    }
  }
  catch(Exception ex){
    contents = ex.getMessage();
  } finally {
    if(reader!=null) reader.close();
  }
  contents = sb.toString();
</pre>
