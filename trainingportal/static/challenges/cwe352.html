<p>
    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)".
  <blockquote>
    <p>
         <i>The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, 
             valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.</i>

  <h5>A Bit About CSRF</h5>
  <p>
    CSRF and XSS are related. They are both part of a category of attacks known as Client Side attacks. 
    They are called this way because they occur in the browser and usually have the target the user of the application rather than the server.
  </p>
<p>
If an application only relies on cookies to validate the authentication of a request, it allows CSRF.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following attack scenario.
<ul>
    <li>You are browsing the Internet, in one tab you have your banking site while in another you have your favorite discussion board. </li>
    <li>One of the users of the board has replaced their avatar with an HTTP request to your bank transferring $100 to an overseas account.</li>
    <li>When your browser loads the discussion board, it will automatically send the request 
        that was stored in the attacker's avatar using the active cookies from the bank tab</li>
</ul>
 
</p>

<h5>About the Challenge</h5> 
<p>Just like in the challenge before you have to exploit the social networking feature where users can see each others profiles. 
</p>

<p>
    Use CSRF to cause any user that sees your profile to change their Display Name to <code>Banjo</code>
</p>
<p>PS: The developers have introduced a feature to filter out tags and prevent the XSS seen in the previous challenge. 
  You will have to figure out how to send the request to update other users profiles without using HTML markup.
