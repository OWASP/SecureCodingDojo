<p>This code block protects against software weaknesses such as <strong>Missing/Incorrect Authorization</strong></p>

<p>
Resource separation/segmentation minimizes the impact of an unauthorized access by limiting the resources that a certain user or role has access to.
</p>
<p>
Resources can be network resources such as LANs or data resources such as different customer databases used in a SaaS offering.
</p>
<p>
If an attacker obtains access to the account of an administrator for one of the resources they do not have access to the other resources in the system.
</p>
<p>
    Same approach can be applied to software development where URLs and other server resources can be segmented based on access.
</p>
<p>
This approach also avoids logical attacks. For example if an application defines a class of servlets that can only be accessed by administrators, 
this reduces the risk of logical flaws being introduced because the authorization logic can be simplified and declared in a base class.</p>

    <p><i>
        "Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality. 
        Use role-based access control (RBAC) [R.862.1] to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.
Note that this approach may not protect against horizontal authorization, i.e., it will not protect a user from attacking others with the same role."</i>
