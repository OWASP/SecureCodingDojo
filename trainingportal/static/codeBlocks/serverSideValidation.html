<p>This code block protects against software weaknesses such as Reliance on Untrusted Input in a Security Decision</p>

        "Developers may assume that inputs such as cookies, environment variables, and hidden form fields cannot be modified. 
        However, an attacker could change these inputs using customized clients or other attacks. This change might not be detected. 
        When security decisions such as authentication and authorization are made based on the values of these inputs, attackers can bypass the security of the software.
        Without sufficient encryption, integrity checking, or other mechanism, any input that originates from an outsider cannot be trusted."</i>

<p>
All validation code should be stored on the server side. Client side validation, even if it seems to work within the UI, can be easily bypassed by 
navigating directly to the unprotected resources or manipulating network traffic.
</p>
<p>
In Java EE applications, a convenient way to store information about the current user, is the session variable. The information is stored in the server memory
and is retrieved for each request and passed to the servlet or JSP code.

The example below shows the proper way to validate a user role based on the information stored in the session rather than the HTTP request parameters.

<pre class="pre-scrollable">
&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot; contentType=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;
    pageEncoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;%&gt;
&lt;%@ page import=&quot;inc.inc.insecure.*&quot; %&gt;
&lt;%

if(session.getAttribute("ch2loggedin")==null || !(boolean)session.getAttribute("ch2loggedin")){
	response.sendRedirect("ch2.jsp?loggedin=false");
}
else{
	boolean isAdmin=(boolean)session.getAttribute("isAdmin"); //notice this time the session variable is used to obtain information about the user role
	if(isAdmin){
        //administration page logic here
        //...
    }
}
</pre>
