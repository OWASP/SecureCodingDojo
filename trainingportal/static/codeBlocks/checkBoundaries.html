<p>This secure coding practice prevents overflow attacks such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound</li>
        <li>Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')</li>
        <li>Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
Whenever user input is received developers should check that the input cannot be used to influence overflows on boundaries, whether it is MAX_INT or whether it is the maximum size allocated for a buffer.
</p>
<p>A simple comparison against a known limit constant can go a long way to prevent serious logical attacks.</p>
<p>Interesting fact, Boeing had to fix a Integer Overflow in the 787 Dreamliner which could cause it's electrical system to fail according to
