<p>
    <strong>Input Whitelisting</strong> also known as Input Validation or Input Sanitization is a tenet of application security. 
    It is the single most important countermeasure that will prevent a large amount of attacks.
</p>
<p>
    Here are a few of the SANS 25 that are prevented or at least mitigated through Input Whitelisting. 
    Even if Whitelisting cannot be employed in some cases, if used for most inputs it reduces the attack surface and the risk to the application.
    <ul>
        <li>URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')<small> -- allow only whitelisted urls </small></li>
        <li>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') <small> -- allow only alphanumeric</small></li>
        <li>Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') <small> -- allow only alphanumeric or allow only whitelisted files</small> </li>
        <li>Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type <small> -- allow only safe file extensions</small></li>
        <li>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')<small> -- allow only alphanumeric</small></li>
        <li>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')<small> -- allow only alphanumeric</small></li>
        <li>Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')<small> -- limit size</small></li>
    </ul>

<h5>Input Whitelisting vs. Input Blacklisting</h5>
<p>
    The choice of using the term 'Whitelisting' instead of 'Validation' or 'Sanitization' was made to differentiate from the bad kind of validation: 'Blacklisting'.
</p>
<p>
    Blacklisting involves blocking certain strings or characters. It can almost always be defeated by skilled attackers. 
    You'd think it's better than nothing but you'd be wrong. Blacklisting masks vulnerabilities for automated tools and testers that are less skilled.
</p>
<p>
    The example below tries to prevent a command injection attack (inspired from a real life scenario, the <a href="https://imagetragick.com/">ImageTragik bug</a> - translated to Java from C++)
</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
    String location=request.getParameter("location");
    if(location.indexOf(";")!=-1){
        throw new Exception("Invalid character in location"); //prevent adding commands to wget using the ; character: location=www.google.com;ls -la
    }
    else{
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/bin/sh -c 'wget "+location+"'");
    }
</pre>
<p>
    The attacker can still inject commands without the <mark>;</mark> symbol, for example they can use the <mark>`</mark> character: <code>location=www.google.com`ls -la`</code> 
</p>
<br>
<h5>Input Whitelisting Rules</h5>
<p>All user input should be considered unsafe by default. </p>
<p>The majority of input used in an application ends up being numeric or alphanumeric strings. 
    Even when other characters are required they are usually part of a limited set. 
    So only alphanumeric characters should be allowed by default while other can be added on exception. </p>
<p>The example below implements input whitelisting</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">

    public static boolean isAlphanumOrExcepted(in maxSize, String val, char ... excepted){
        boolean result = true;
        int count = val.length();
        if(count>maxSize) return false;

        for(int i=0;i&lt;count;i++){
        	char c = val.charAt(i);
        	boolean isOk = false;
        	//if  alphabetic turns true , this works for Unicode chars
        	isOk = isOk | Character.isAlphabetic(c);
        	//if it's a digit turns true, this works for Unicode chars
        	isOk = isOk | Character.isDigit(c);
        	//if it's in the list of exceptions turns true
        	for(char ex : excepted){
        		isOk = isOk | ex==c;
        	}
        	
        	if(isOk == false){ //if the character didn't meet the requirements return false
        		return false;
        	}
        }
        return result;
    }
    //...
    String location=request.getParameter("location");
    if(isAlphanumOrException(32, location,':','/','?')){
        throw new Exception("Invalid character in location"); //only allow a limited set of valid url characters 
    }
    else{
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/bin/sh -c 'wget "+location+"'"); //btw there is a better way to call shell commands which reduces the risk of command injection, see parameterized commands code block
    }
</pre>

<p>In Node.js there's a handy validator package containing various validation techniques</p>

<br>
<h5>Input Whitelisting as a Framework</h5>
<p>If possible whitelisting should be built into the API or Framework. 
    Ideally a new developer writing a new REST API should automatically benefit from whitelisting and only add extra characters or symbols as needed.</p>
<p>
    This can be done by introducing whitelisting as part of the default data processing routines. 
    At a minimum a common validation class should be made available and used every time user input is accepted and be enforced as part of coding guidelines.
</p>
<p>The example below shows the implementation of a 'SafeGetParameter' function that can be reused to ensure validation</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
     String userId=Util.SafeGetParameter(32,request,"userId",ValidatorConstants.ALPHA_NUM); 
</pre>
