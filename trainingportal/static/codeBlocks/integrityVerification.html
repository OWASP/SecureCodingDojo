<p>This code block protects against software weaknesses such as <strong>Download of Code without Integrity Check</strong></p>

<p>
Most communication protocols have some level of integrity checks built in, primarily to account for data degradation or corruption. 
These mechanism vary from simple checksums, to MD5 or SHA digests. Git, for example, implements a SHA-1 mechanism to identify commits.
</p>
<p>
When security is involved developers should be concerned with attackers potentially intercepting update packages and replacing them with malware. 
This should be an expecially high concern for security software which are used to fight malware. The absence of integrity checks allows the manipulation of update packages.

<p>
Simple checksums and digests can be bypassed through <mark>collisions</mark>. MD5 collisions can be identified in 1 day while 
SHA-1 collisions can be identified in 1 year <a target="_blank" href="http://shattered.io/">as disclosed by Google researchers in 2017</a>.
</p>
<p>
The importance of the Google discovery is significant since many SSL certificates are signed with SHA-1 hashes for integrity. 
This means that man-in-the-middle attackers with sufficient computing power could potentially create fake SSL certificates using a different public key and break secure communications.
</p>
<p>
Algorithms in the <strong>SHA-2</strong> class such as SHA-256 still remain safe until more computing power can break them. 
However even with SHA-256 there still remains the problem of transmitting the hashes to the receiving party. If the hashes are transmitted through a separate channel this channel should be secure.
</p>
<p>
   An approach that attempts to resolve this problem is using RSA signatures in a similar way TLS communication works. Here is the process at a high level:
       <ul>
        <li>The software update site provides a certificate which can be verified by a public authority such as Verisign</li>
        <li>The private key for this certificate is closely guarded and never shared with consumers of the software</li>
        <li>When new software is released the update package is hashed using a strong algorithm (SHA-256+)</li>
        <li>The hash is in turn encrypted with the private key that only the software provider knows</li>
        <li>The software signing certificate containing the public key is packaged along with the software and the encrypted hash</li>
        <li>When the software consumer downloads the package it first checks that the certificate is valid (using the trusted Certificate authority)</li>
        <li>Next the consumer uses the public key to decrypt the hash and verifies that it matches the update contents. 
            Since RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm only the signer can generate a valid encrypted hash.</li>
    </ul>
