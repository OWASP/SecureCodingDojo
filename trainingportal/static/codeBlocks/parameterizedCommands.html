<p>This code block protects against Injection weaknesses such as <strong>OS Command Injection</strong> and <strong>SQL Injection</strong></p>

<p>
The most common types of commands used by software are OS Commands and SQL Commands. 
Parameterizing a command involves passing user input as command arguments rather than constructing a literal statement.
</p>
<p>
The unsafe way of constructing a command is by concatenating user input. <mark>Concatenation allows injection</mark>.
</p>

<h5>Parameterized SQL Commands</h5>

<p>
Here is the correct way of executing a database query using prepared statements.
<pre>
    <strong>String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE usr =<mark>?</mark> AND pwd=<mark>?</mark>";</strong>
    PreparedStatement ps = conn.preparedStatement(query);
    stmt.setString(1, usr); 
    stmt.setString(2, pwd); 
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery(query);
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> Prepared statements will not protect against situations when the input is being again concatenated in an SQL Procedure. 
Input validation or moving the SQL logic into the middleware can prevent against those cases.
</p>


<h5>Parameterized OS Commands</h5>

<p>Java conveniently offers a safe way to execute commands. The following example shows executing the <code>ping</code> utility with arguments.
<pre>
    String server = req.getParameter("server");
    String [] commandArgs = {"-c","1",server};
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ping",commandArgs);
</pre>

Keep in mind that this safe method won't protect from situations where the arguments are passed as an argument to the shell. 
This type of code below should be avoided.

<pre>
    String server = req.getParameter("server");
    String [] commandArgs = {"-c", String.format("ping -c 1 %s",server)};
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("<mark>/bin/sh</mark>",commandArgs);
</pre>

Also the method will be useless when shell scripts, python, perl etc are called with the arguments. The injection may occur in the shell script. <b>Input Whitelisting</b> can prevent those situations.
