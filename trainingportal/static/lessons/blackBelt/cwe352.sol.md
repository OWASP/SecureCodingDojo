### Solution for the "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)" challenge

This challenge demonstrates a CSRF attack caused by a missing **synchronizer token** in a sensitive request.

To solve the challenge do the following:

* Update your profile to change the **Display Name** to `Banjo`, and **record that particular URL**.
* Use the particular URL as a payload, to force the victim update their own **Display Name**. In this case, replace the **avatar link**.
When the victim browses to the attacker's profile the browser will automatically load the avatar and update the **Display Name** for the current user.
