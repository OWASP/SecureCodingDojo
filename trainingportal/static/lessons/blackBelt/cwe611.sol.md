### Solution for the "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')" challenge

This challenge showcases how a seemingly harmless XML file can be used to exfiltrate data from a remote computer through a XML parsing vulnerability.

To pass the challenge simply create a xml file with the `.svg` file extension: **myavatar.svg**, which contains a DTD definition referencing **`/etc/passwd`**. Please reference the payload below.

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
    <svg width="100" height="100"><text x="10" y="20" fill="red">&xxe;</text></svg>

Upload the malicious svg file to the application and observe that the response is including the contents of **`/etc/passwd`**.
Use **view source** in your browser to view the actual contents of the `passwd` file.
