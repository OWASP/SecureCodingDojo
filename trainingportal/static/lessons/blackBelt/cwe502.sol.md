### Solution for the "Deserialization of Untrusted Data" challenge

This challenge shows the combined risk of deserializing attacker controlled objects and using outdated 3rd party libraries, even if not directly referenced. 

To complete the challenge you need to do the following:

- Generate a serialized attack gadget using `ysoserial`. Please read the challenge details for instructions on how to use `ysoserial`
- The gadget should execute the command `touch /tmp/YOUR_FILE_NAME` where `YOUR_FILE_NAME` is something you choose
- The gadget should use the `CommonsCollections6` payload
- If you run `ysoserial` from a container run the following command first `docker run --entrypoint sh -it frohoff/ysoserial`
- Then run the following command to generate the gadget `java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections6 'touch /tmp/YOUR_FILE_NAME'|base64`
- Replace the base64 encoded string for the "Cat" object with the attack gadget base64 string
- Enter the chosen `YOUR_FILE_NAME` for validation and submit

Note: If you get the message _"Gadget command validation failed. Only commands like `'touch /tmp/YOUR_FILE_NAME'` are allowed."_, one of the following may have happened:

- You used the wrong command when you generated the gadget. You are only allowed to execute `touch /tmp/YOUR_FILE_NAME` for obvious reasons :)
- You entered the wrong file name. The server cannot validate the command
