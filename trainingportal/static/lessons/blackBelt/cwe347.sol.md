### Solution for "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature" challenge

Systems that utilize JWT authentication must perform several checks on the token supplied in the request to have a robust authentication mechanism:

- The supplied token signature matches the signature calculated for the body based on the secret only available to the server side application  
- The token is not expired  
- If the system implements token revocation, that the token is not revoked  

To pass this challenge: 

- Locate the JWT associated to your login  
- Modify the token so that the role assigned to the token is "admin" - one useful tool that may help here is [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)  
- Submit the modified token to the server to elevate your permissions to admin - notice that the application doesn't validate the JWT signature calculated for the body
