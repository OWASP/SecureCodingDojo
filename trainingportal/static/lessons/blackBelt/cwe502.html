<p>
  The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE weakness: CWE 502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data.

<li>MITRE CWE 502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data
    <blockquote>
    <i>The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.</i>

<p>In a deserialization vulnerability, the application accepts a serialized object as input, loads it into memory and operates on it. The potential damage depends entirely upon how the object is used.  For example, if code 
in your application were to call System.exec() on data stored in the object, then an attacker-controlled command
would execute on your host, under your application's privileges.   As it turns out, 
<a targer="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Basic&results_type=overview&query=deserialization&search_type=all">some third party libraries automatically do this for you!</a>  

<p>
The combination of using unpatched 3rd party components and the unsafe use of deserialization can be fatal. 
The scariest part is that 3rd party components don't even need to be directly used. 
They only need to be on the class path of the vulnerable application and they'll automatically execute commands
included in the unsafe object.
</p>

<p>Even products that accepted the serialized object, deserialized it into an in-memory object, and ran into an 
exception when casting into a different, expected class were vulnerable - this short time window is enough to 
consistently create the malicious object and get its payload executed. 
</p>

<p>This vulnerability was originally reported against the Java-native deserialization vulnerability, but it
doesn't end there.  Your application can have this vulnerability if it does <em>any</em> deserialization - even 
custom deserialization of JSON objects.  If your object allows input (user input, remote systems, files or 
database entries that anyone else may have written, etc) to arbirarially control which class your code will 
instantiate, then you probably have a desearialization vulnerability.

<h4>Exploiting Deserialization</h4>
<p>
The Open Source project <a href="https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial">ysoserial</a> provides an open source tool to test and exploit Insecure Deserialization flaws in Java apps.
</p>
<br></br>

<h4>About the Challenge</h4>
<p>
The website allows an administration page to process Java objects. 
The password to the administration site is one of the most commonly used (see brute force challenge)
</p>


<p>
Once you are logged in you will notice that the application unsafely accepts serialized objects. 
In addition there's a <code>commons-collections-3.1.jar</code>   in <code>/webapp/WEB-INF/lib.</code></p>
<p>
Here's a code snippet:
</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
String b64String = request.getParameter("object");
String filename = request.getParameter("filename");
//..
byte [] objBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(b64String);
//..
ByteArrayInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(objBytes);
ObjectInputStream is = new ObjectInputStream(in);
Object cat = is.readObject(); 
</pre>

<p>
You can use ysoserial to generate a base64 encoded gadget.
The challenge is to create a file using a file name of your choosing in the 'tmp' folder of the server.
</p>
<p>
If you download ysoserial from a Docker Hub be advised that the output of docker run may get corrupted and the attack won't work.
</p>
<p>
To get around this issue override the "entrypoint" like this
</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
docker run --entrypoint sh -it frohoff/ysoserial
</pre>
<p>
Then run the command:
</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections6 'touch /tmp/YOUR_FILE_NAME'|base64
</pre>
