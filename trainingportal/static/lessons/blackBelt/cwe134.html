<p>
    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the <strong>Use of Externally-Controlled Format String</strong>, MITRE Top 25 vulnerability.
    <ul>
      <li>Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
        <blockquote>
          <i>The software uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source</i>    
          <footer>From MITRE <a target="_blank" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html">CWE 134</a></footer>

<h4>A Bit About Format String Injection</h4>
<p>
Format string injection vulnerabilities happen when user input is passed into printf and the user can insert a format construct in the input.
</p>
<p>
For example if <code>userInput="%s"</code> and the code is <pre>printf(userInput)</pre> the printf function will attempt to print a string from the stack, where normally you would find a variable address.
</p>
<p>Format string attacks are difficult to exploit in modern operating systems however they can still be very dangerous and at least crash the software by causing a segfault.</p>

<h4>About the Challenge</h4>
<p>
  The developers of the master password app have implemented the safe function <mark>fgets</mark> so buffer overflow is no longer possible. 
  However you may be able to obtain data from the memory. You don't need to get the password, just some memory values are enough to pass the challenge.
</p>

<p>
  Here is the master password program code. See if you can spot the problems.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(){
	char MASTER_PASSWORD[9]="***EDITED***";
	char userPass[9];
	int x=2;
	printf("Enter the master password:\n");
	fgets(userPass,9,stdin);

	if(strcmp(userPass,MASTER_PASSWORD)==0){
		printf("PASSWORD VERIFIED\n");
	}
	else{
		printf("Invalid password:");
		printf(userPass);
	}
	return 0;
}
