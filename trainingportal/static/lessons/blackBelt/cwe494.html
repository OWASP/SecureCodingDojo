    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: 'Download of Code Without Integrity Check'.
<br><br>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
         <i>The product downloads source code or an executable from a remote location and executes the code without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of the code.</i>
    </p>
    <footer>From MITRE <a target="_blank" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html">CWE 494</a></footer>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Security breaches are usually done by leveraging multiple vulnerabilities also known as <i>"death by 1000 cuts"</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the previous challenge you broke into the admin's account using a password guessing attack. 
   Now you take the breach to the next level by taking control over the server. You have to download the malware from your C&amp;C server: <code>evil.bad</code>.
  </p>
  <p>Conveniently, there are no integrity checks in place.</p>
