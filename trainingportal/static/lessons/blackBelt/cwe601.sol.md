### Solution for the "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')" challenge

This challenge demonstrates a common mistake, the application abusing the redirect location without verifying the destination using an allow list.

On this challenge you don't need to login. Construct the URL that you will send to the admin in order to redirect them to the evil site and navigate to it.

This is done by setting the value of the **redirect** parameter to `http://evil.bad`
