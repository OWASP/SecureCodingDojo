### Solution for "Integer Overflow or Wraparound" challenge

This challenge demonstrates the risk of not checking boundaries.

This time the application employs an account lockout mechanism, however the number of account attempts can increase until the `MAX_UINT` limit is reached and the counter becomes `-MAX_UINT` because the first byte turns to 1.

The attacker ran a bruteforce attack until they discovered the password, but the account is now locked.

To solve the challenge do the following:

- Keep entering an invalid password until the counter becomes negative.
- Enter the password you have discoved in the previous challenge to login.
