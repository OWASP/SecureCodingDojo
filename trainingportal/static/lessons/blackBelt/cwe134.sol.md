### Solution for the "Use of Externally-Controlled Format String" challenge

This challenge demonstrates a **format string injection** vulnerability. **Format string injection** is caused by formatting symbols being allowed into a `C++` function such as `printf`.

Observe how in the sample vulnerable code the line: `printf(userPass)`, allows the attacker to pass in formatting constructs to `printf`. This allows the attacker to read arbitrary values from the memory.

    if(strcmp(userPass,MASTER_PASSWORD)==0){
		printf("PASSWORD VERIFIED\n");
	}
	else{
		printf("Invalid password:");
		printf(userPass);
	}


To pass this challenge, try to input the formatting strings below.

1. %s
2. %0
3. %x
4. %f
5. %d
