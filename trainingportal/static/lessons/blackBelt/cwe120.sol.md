### Solution for the "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') and related flaws" challenge

This challenge demonstrates a buffer overflow where the application uses the `gets` function and allows the attacker to control the size of the input buffer. This leads to the neighbouring memory locations being overriden.

To pass this challenge all you have to do is fill the buffer with zeros: `\0`. 

The character value `\0` is a string terminator. By filling the memory with zeros you are making both strings empty strings (`""`) and `equal`, thus bypassing password validation, 

The URL representation for `\0` is `%00`.

Keep adding `%00` in the url until both buffers are empty.
