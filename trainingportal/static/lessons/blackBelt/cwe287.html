  <h4>About the Challenge</h4>
    The developer of the vulnerable application has implemented improper authentication that can be easily bypassed.
    The application properly authenticates a user's credentials but then assigns a predictable value to the user's browser local storage or cookies to represent the user's session.
    See if you can become authenticated without providing valid credentials.
