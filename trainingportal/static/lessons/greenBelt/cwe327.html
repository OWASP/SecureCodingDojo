    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: 'Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm'. 
<br><br>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
         <i>Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. 
         This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong.</i>

    This is the same vulnerable application from the previous challenge. 
    The developers are now hashing the user password but is it the right algorithm? They still haven't fixed the missing authorization issue by the way.

    Did you know that there are online sites like  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashes.com/">Hashes.com</a> or 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dcode.fr/">dcode.fr</a> that maintain a list of known hashes for numbers and dictionary words, also known as a
