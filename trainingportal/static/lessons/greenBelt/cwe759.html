    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: 'Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt'. 
<br><br>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
         <i>The software uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the software does not also use a salt as part of the input.</i>

    This is the same vulnerable application from the previous challenge, still with missing authorization on the admin page where you can see the users and their passwords. 
    The developers are now hashing the user password with an algorithm considered safe but is it enough?

<p>
    Did you know that there are online sites like  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashes.com/">Hashes.com</a> or 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dcode.fr/">dcode.fr</a> that maintain a list of known hashes for numbers and dictionary words, also known as a

    Obtain the password for <code>user</code> and login to solve the challenge.
    See if you can spot the problem in the code below.
