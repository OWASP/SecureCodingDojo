### Solution for "Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt" challenge

Even when algorithms considered secure are being used, cracking can still be employed, especially if the password can be easily found in a dictionary or is a relatively small number.

In order to prevent such attacks, passwords are salted with a random value which prevents the use of pre-calculated rainbow tables.


To pass this challenge: 

- List the user password by leveraging the Missing Authorization vulnerability just like in the previous case.
- Search for the hash on your online hash look-up service of choice.
- Logout and re-login as '**user**' with the cracked password to solve the challenge.
