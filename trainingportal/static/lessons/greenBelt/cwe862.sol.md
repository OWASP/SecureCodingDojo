### Solution for "Missing Authorization" challenge

The application in this challenge does not employ any authorization checks on the administrative page.

In spite of the fact that the admin page is hidden it can still be accessed by url guessing. 
OWASP ZAP comes with a Fuzzer tool which includes a collection of payloads called 'dirbuster'. Using the ZAP fuzzer with dirbuster allows automated detection of commonly used urls.

After logging into the vulnerable app you will notice that the URL looks like this: `cwe862loggedin.jsp`

To pass the challenge simply change the value of the url string from **loggedin** to **admin**. The application should rely on more than just obscurity to protect the admin pages.
