    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: 'Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')'.

    The developer of this part of the site has implemented a server side calculator that expects a mathematical expression from the user to calculate.
    The issue is that the server side code runs the user input through eval(), which means that any input is treated as executable code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below is a portion of the application code. You will see the developers are also loading some other unrelated backend utility code into the runtime environment. See if you can determine a way to exploit this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your task is to invoke the existing `deleteHistory` utility loaded into the runtime environment, likely causing issues to data stored somewhere on the server side.

    public static String calculate(String mathematicalExpression) {

        engine.eval("var password = '" + PASSWORD + "';");

        Object outcome = engine.eval(mathematicalExpression);
