    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate password guessing attacks.
    These are made possible by MITRE Top 25 programming flaws such as: 
    <ul>
      <li>CWE 307 - Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts</li>
        <blockquote>
          <i>The software does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within in a short time frame, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.</i>

        </blockquote>
      <li>CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials</li>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
            <i>The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, 
              outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.</i>
        </p>

    </ul>
    

<p>Password guessing attacks are very simple and don't require security knowledge. In fact the first Guccifer, Marcel Lehel,
  was an unemployed taxi driver and ended up breaking into the accounts of high ranking US politicians.</p>
<p>Password guessing is also featured in many movies when the main character finds themselves in front of a locked computer screen and
  uses information from their surroundings to try to break in.

<h4>About the Challenge</h4>
  <p>
    The developers of the application have created an administration account to manage different configurations of the application.
    For convenience the password was hard-coded in the JSP file.
    The password for the <code>admin</code> user also happens to be an insecure password. One of the top 10 most insecure passwords.
