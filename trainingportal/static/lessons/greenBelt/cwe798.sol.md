### Solution for "Use of Hard-coded Credentials" challenge

Application secrets need to be highly protected, as they will often allow privileged access to parts of the system.
Hardcoding the secrets as part of the application is a poor choice for protection, regardless of the application running client side or server side.


To pass this challenge: 

- Download the `Insecure Inc. System Validator` file after logging in with the guest account.
- `Do not run the file`
- Upload the JAR to an online java decompiler, unarchive the .jar file by changing the extension to .zip or by running `jar xf validate.jar`
- Review the archived contents for credentials that can be used for authentication.
