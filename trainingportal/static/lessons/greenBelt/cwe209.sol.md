### Solution for "Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information" challenge

Error messages can contain detailed information about how the application operates, as well as sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.  
Instead of allowing detailed error messages to be returned to the user, generic error messages with an error ID or code should be returned instead.  
The details of the error can be saved to the application logs, accessible only to the application owners.


To pass this challenge: 

- Become familiar with the Insecure Inc. archive search after logging in with the guest account.
- Invoke an error in the archive search by entering characters that might be problematic.
- Review error details for credentials that can be used for authentication.
