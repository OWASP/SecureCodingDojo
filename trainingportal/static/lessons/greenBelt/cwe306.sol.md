### Solution for the "Missing Authentication" challenge

This challenge showcases a situation where an application fails to verify the user credentials when handling a protected resource.

You will notice in the code sample the `isAuthenticated` function was not called in the servlet `doGet` method.
This means an attacker could **forcefully browse** to the servlet url which is defined with `@WebServlet("/Ch1Loggedin")`

When you navigate to the vulnerable app you will notice that submitting the login page without credentials redirects to `_URL_?redirect=/Ch1Loggedin`

To pass the challenge simply navigate directly to the **redirect** url.

**NOTE**: While the vulnerable application here is a web site (for the purpose of providing a easily accessible gaming platform), 
the concepts behind **Missing Authentication** apply to non-webapps as well.

* Non-webapp servers which rely on RMI, RPC or other non-HTTP protocols and ports can be abused in the same way if a sensitive function is not protected with authentication
* Client services, desktop apps or mobile apps can be abused if allow control from a lower privilege user without proper authentication. For example a malware application may interact with a system service via `IPC` and set the `shut down` command. If the command is not authenticated the malware will successfully shut down the service.
