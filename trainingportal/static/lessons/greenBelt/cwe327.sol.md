### Solution for "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" challenge

This challenge shows a case where security practices were employed, however they become outdated as computing power has increased, no longer matching cryptographic standards.

Did you know collisions to the MD5 hashing algorithm can be calculated within 1 day at modern computing power? This means that if an attacker knows the hash they could generate a string that will result in the same hash within 1 day. The SHA-1 algorithm has also been proven be prone to collisions, although it requires more computing power.

However there's an even easier way to exploit these algorithms. There are online sites that maintain a large database of precalculated hashes. Because MD5 and SHA-1 require less computing power it is easier to pre-calculate hashes for such algorithms.

To pass this challenge: 

- List the user password by leveraging the Missing Authorization vulnerability just like in the previous case.
- Search for the hash on your online hash look-up service of choice.
- Logout and re-login as '**user**' with the cracked password to solve the challenge.
