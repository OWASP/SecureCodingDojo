### Solution for "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data" challenge

In this challenge the user passwords are not hashed. Instead they are **base64 encoded**. 

Base64 encoding converts special unicode characters or binary data to ASCII. Base64 encoding is used to store or transfer passwords in many cases. One very common example is **Basic Authentication**, a common authentication method used by web servers.

Cryptographic flaws are many times exploited via a different vulnerability such as an Authorization Bypass, SQL Injection or a physical attack. This is the case in the challenge. The attacker gains access to an administration page listing passwords, via the authorization flaw demonstrated earlier.

Just like in the previous challenge you have to **forcefully browse** to the admin page by changing the url from **loggedin** to **admin** .

Then you arrive at a page listing the user names and passwords on the site including a temporary reversible password for '**user**'which is stored in **base64** encoding.

Use an online base64 decoder to decode the temporary password.

Logout and re-login as '**user**' with the decoded password to solve the challenge.
