<h5>About the vulnerabilities: Injection</h5>
<p>
  Injection is discussed and demonstrated in detail under
   <strong>Brown Belt: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') and related flaws</strong>
    and under
    <strong>Brown Belt: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')</strong>
    <br>Please review those sections to refresh your memory and also the OWASP link below.

    <i>An application is vulnerable to attack when:

        User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.
    
        Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
    
        Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
    
        Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.

<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
- The attackers have built in a service that can execute requests inside the CnC environment, such as a ping request to test whether a host is up.
<br>- Very similar to the challenge under brown belt, the host name here allows more than it should.
<br>- Look for the 'secret' file on the file system of the 'pinger' host.
<br>- Besides the 'secret' file you will find the coordinates of an internal application, located on a different host, which is used to control the bots. 
<br>- The pinger will become your "beachhead" in interacting with this application.
