<h5>About the vulnerabilities: Cryptographic Failure</h5>
<blockquote class="blockquote m-4">
<p >
    <i>Scenario #3: The password database uses unsalted or simple hashes to store everyone's passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password database. All the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of pre-calculated hashes. Hashes generated by simple or fast hash functions may be cracked by GPUs, even if they were salted.</i>

<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
<p>
- Along with the 'secret' file you will find many other files in the bucket including the html for a chat application that the hackers use. 
<br>- The users file for the application can be found in the same bucket and the passwords are stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes.
<br>- The users of the system have strong passwords but the test account not so much. 
<br>- Crack the test account password and login into the chat to pass this challenge.
