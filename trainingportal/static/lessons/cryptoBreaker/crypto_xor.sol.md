### Solution for "XOR" challenge

Remember that in XOR the key, plain text and the cipher are interchangeable (if they have the same length).

To obtain the characters of the key, all you have to do is to XOR the given hex values of the cipher with the known plain text: `LOREM IPSUM DOLOR SIT AMET`

- Go to your online XOR decoder of choice
- Provide the hex values of the cipher
- Provide `LOREM IPSUM DOLOR SIT AMET` **as an ASCII KEY**
