Computers store text as a sequence of numbers.
The ASCII encoding was one of the first methods of computer representation for English alphabet characters. 

#### Algorithm
Map each letter to a number.

##### Example
ABCD becomes 65 66 67 68 in decimal, 41 42 43 44 in hexadecimal (Base16)


##### Weakness
It can be easily deciphered using the well known ASCII character map.
